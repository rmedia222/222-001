                    Dreams are related to memory fragments
                </div>
                <div>
                    Freud, the originator of dream psychology, said that dreams are the satisfaction of subconscious desires. Dreams are a window through which the conscious mind looks into the unconscious.

      To put it bluntly, whatever desires and pursuits we have,
      <span class="text-blue-600">these desires and pursuits will be woven into a seemingly illusory dream</span>.
      But in fact, these illusory dreams are all related to reality.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4 font-bold">
      For example, when we dream about our deceased parents and relatives, are these dream images false?
    </p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
      In fact, the images in dreams are originally related to our
      <span class="text-blue-600">memory fragments</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-red-600 text-base font-bold">
      Mostly it's a psychological suggestion.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-6">
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
      There is no need to be afraid of dreams, and there is no need to ignore everything that happens in dreams. Because the appearance of dreams is more or less a
      <span class="font-semibold">"psychological"</span> suggestion.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
      It turns out that <span class="text-blue-600">from time to time, I often dream about my parents and relatives who have died long ago</span>, which often has these
      <span class="text-blue-600">hints</span>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-green-600 mb-2">1. Extreme longing for loved ones.</h2>
    <p class="text-base mb-2">
      As the saying goes: <span class="font-semibold">"Think about it every day and dream about it at night."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="text-base">
      Excessively missing your loved ones will trigger memories related to your loved ones, intentionally or unintentionally. As soon as these memories appear, they are bound to have an impact on our dreams.

    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-6">
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
      Psychologist Freud believed that the content of dreams is related to the people and things that have been contacted in the past week.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
      It is said that when he was a child, Freud was scolded by his father for wetting the bed.
      <span class="font-bold">When he grew up, he remembered this incident again.</span> That night, he
      <span class="text-blue-600">dreamed that he and his father went to the train station</span> and went to the station toilet to relieve themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
      Regarding this dreaming situation, Freud put forward a point of view. Dreams are a form of fantasy that allows people to experience the satisfaction of this coveted instinct.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
      In the final analysis, this is all related to daily
      <span class="font-semibold">"missing"</span>. You know, people are very nostalgic creatures, and they also value emotions. At this time, dreaming about loved ones is inevitable.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-green-600 mb-2">2. Come into contact with objects related to them.</h2>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
      Some <span class="text-blue-600">psychological researchers</span> have conducted such a survey and found that people's thoughts and changes in their thoughts are all related to the
      <span class="font-semibold">"objects"</span> they come into contact with.
    </p>
    <p class="text-base mb-4">
      When we come into contact with some old photos, we will recall the people and things in the photos; when we come into contact with some old objects, we will recall everything related to these objects.
    </p>
  </div>
  <img src="../../src/images/must-read/001-3.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto">
        <p>This is what we often say, <span class="font-semibold">“seeing things and thinking about people.”</span> Without a certain object, it will arouse certain thoughts. All the pull of thinking is the inevitable result of the mutual contact between <span class="font-semibold">"people"</span> and <span class="font-semibold">"things"</span>.</p>
        
        <p>Why do some people dream about past events or even these deceased people after paying homage to their ancestors? It's because they came into contact with objects related to their ancestors.</p>
        
        <p>Some psychologists have said that <span class="text-blue-600">dreams connect distant but related memories and strengthen them into a story</span>.</p>
        
        <p>To put it bluntly, as long as these memories are in our minds, we believe that these memories will be driven by the objects we come into contact with, thus creating dreams like <span class="font-semibold">"stories"</span>.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold text-xl">3. Certain changes occur in the family.</h3>
        
        <p>The famous psychological expert <span class="text-blue-600">Mr. Hao Bin</span> believes that dreams in some cases are manifestations of psychological conflicts.</p>
        
        <p>What exactly is <span class="font-semibold">"psychological conflict"</span>? It can be summed up in two words - <span class="font-semibold">contradiction</span>. There is a certain conflict between what we think in our hearts and all the people and things we see and come into contact with in our daily lives.</p>
        
        <p>For example, brothers and sisters in the family <span class="text-blue-600">no longer value family affection after their parents leave</span>. We were devastated by this situation and slowly developed a <span class="font-semibold">"ambivalent"</span> mentality.</p>
    </div>
    <img src="../../src/images/must-read/001-4.jpg" alt="">
            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded ">
            <p class="mb-4">
                The emergence of this ambivalence is one of the causes of <span class="font-semibold">"dreams"</span>. There are two assumptions in this. First, changes in the family are the <span class="font-semibold">"cause"</span>, and dreaming about deceased parents is the <span class="font-semibold">"effect"</span>. Secondly, dreaming about deceased parents is the <span class="font-semibold">"cause"</span>, and family changes are the <span class="font-semibold">"result"</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Generally speaking, the first hypothesis is consistent with <span class="font-semibold">psychological logic</span>. The second assumption is inconsistent with the <span class="font-semibold">mainstream statement</span>. This is what we often call <span class="font-semibold">"superstition"</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We don’t need to think too much about <span class="font-semibold">“dreaming about deceased relatives”</span>. As long as there are <span class="font-semibold">"conflicts"</span> in people's psychology and family problems arise, <span class="font-semibold">"dreams"</span> will naturally occur. Everything is extremely normal.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-red-500 font-semibold mb-4">Dreams are related to many aspects</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                At the end of the writing, <span class="font-semibold">"dreams"</span> are both realistic and illusory. The key is to analyze them from different angles. But one thing cannot be denied, that is, the appearance of dreams is closely related to people's real psychology.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Why do people who are in trouble and particularly sad have darker background tones in their dreams? Why do people who are in good times and have a happy state of mind have brighter background colors in their dreams?
            </p>

        <img src="../../src/images/must-read/001-5.jpg" alt="">
            <div class="max-w-prose mx-auto">
        <p class="text-red-600 font-bold text-lg">It’s natural, there’s no need to disobey it</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            This is the inevitable result of the combined force of <span class="font-bold">"human brain"</span> and <span class="font-bold">"desire"</span>. Emotions will mobilize different desires. And different desires will be woven into different dreams.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
            Therefore, <span class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">dreaming about deceased relatives is not a bad thing</span>, and there is no need to make a fuss. <span class="font-bold">This is a normal phenomenon</span>. We just need to <span class="font-bold">keep the mentality of letting nature take its course</span>.
